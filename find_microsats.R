#Takes a sequence, seq, and searches for microsatellites. Returns information on the start 
#position and number of repeats for all microsatellites of length >=lenmin and <=lenmax 
#and with at least repmin repeats.
#
#Args
#seq          A character string (possibly quite long) with the sequence (A, T, G, Cs)
#lenmin       Searches for microsats with at least this many characters in them. Must be at
#               least 2.
#lenmax       Searches for microsats with not more than this many characters in them. Cannot
#               be more than 6.
#repmin       A repeat is only considered a microsat if it has at least this many repeats.
#
#Output - a data frame with these columns:
#microsat     The microsat
#loc          The start position
#numrep       The number of repeats
